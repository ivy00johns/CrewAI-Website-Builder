# CrewAI-Website-Builder
## WORK-IN-PROGRESS

# Project Overview
This project leverages the CrewAI framework to automate and streamline website development processes. It utilizes a team of AI agents with specialized roles to handle various aspects of website creation, including design, frontend development, and quality assurance.

# Key Features
* **AI-Powered Agents**: The project employs specialized AI agents for different tasks:
	* UI/UX Designer: Creates visually appealing and user-friendly design concepts.
	* Frontend Engineer: Develops the website's frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
	* Frontend QA Engineer: Tests the website's functionality and identifies any issues.
* **Task-Based Workflow**: The project follows a task-based workflow, where each agent is assigned specific tasks to complete. This ensures a structured and organized development process.
* **Comprehensive Development**: The system can handle both basic and complete website development projects, offering flexibility based on the user's needs.
* **CrewAI Framework**: The project is built on top of the CrewAI framework, which provides a robust and scalable foundation for managing AI agents and tasks.
